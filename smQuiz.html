            1.	Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems?<br>
            - <br>
            2.	What is the purpose of request dispatching? <br>
            - Request dispatching is used to forward a request to other servlets or JSPs and it is used to include the contents of one of these in a response.<br>
            3.	What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch? <br>
            - Redirect sends a request to by sending the client a response (code 302) and a URL to send this request to, while request dispatch sends the same request to another resource in the same context.<br>
            4.	What is an attribute ? <br>
            - An attribute is an object that helps servlets communicate with each other in request, session and application scopes.<br>
            5.	What is the difference between attributes and parameters? <br>
            - A parameter is a string that is sent from client to servers and can be accessed from a servlet request while an attribute is a server variable within a request, session or application scope.<br>
            6.  What are dangers of using attributes? <br>
            - I<br>
            7.	What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol. <br>
            - It means that the server will not relate a request to any previous or future requests; i.e. it doesnâ€™t store states. POP3 for example stores states.<br>
            8.	Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one
            method). <br>
            - Request, session and application scopes and cookies and hidden fields on a form.<br>
            9.	How long does a session last? <br>
            - It generally lasts 30 mins but a max limit time can be set to control that.<br>
